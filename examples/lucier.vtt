0:00:06.760 --> 0:00:14.020
I am sitting in a room different from the one you are in now.

0:00:17.779 --> 0:00:24.550
I am recording the sound of my speaking voice and I am going to play

0:00:24.550 --> 0:00:33.960
it back into the room again and again until the resonant frequencies of the room

0:00:33.960 --> 0:00:49.990
reinforce themselves so that any semblance of my speech, with perhaps the exception of rhythm,

0:00:49.990 --> 0:00:52.949
is destroyed.

0:00:56.419 --> 0:01:07.900
What you will hear, then, are the natural resonant frequencies of the room articulated by

0:01:07.900 --> 0:01:08.560
speech.

0:01:13.090 --> 0:01:25.919
I regard this activity not so much as a demonstration of a physical fact, but

0:01:25.919 --> 0:01:36.050
more as a way to smooth out any irregularities my speech might have.
